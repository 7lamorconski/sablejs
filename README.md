# sablejs
🏖️ The safer and faster ECMA5.1 interpreter written by JavaScript, it can be used:
1. Sandbox(like Figma Plugin Sandbox, but better and easy to use);
2. Mini Program/Game JavaScript dynamic execution;
3. Protect JavaScript source code via AOT compiling to opcode;

sablejs may be the fastest interpreter written by JavaScript:
* 2.x ~ 3.x slower than QuickJS WebAssembly;
* More than 2 twice faster than sval, eval5;
* More than 7 twice faster than js-interpreter, engine262, etc;

and sablejs's file size is only ~50KB (with GZIP🥰).

**Current progress:**
1. Except for Object/JSON, other logic has been completed
2. Test262 has been integrated, version 1.0 will be released after the pass rate is over 90%

It will be coming soon...
