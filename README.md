# sablejs
🏖️ The safer and faster ECMA5.1 interpreter written by JavaScript, it can be used:
1. Sandbox(like Figma Plugin Sandbox, but better and easy to use);
2. Mini Program/Game JavaScript dynamic execution;
3. Protect JavaScript source code via AOT compiling to opcode;

sablejs may be the fastest interpreter written in JavaScript:
* 1.x ~ 2.x slower than WebAssembly QuickJS;
* 1.x faster than sval, eval5;
* 7.x ~ 8.x faster than js-interpreter, engine262, etc;

and sablejs's file size is only ~50KB (with GZIP🥰).

It will be coming soon...
