# sablejs
🏖️ The safer and faster ECMA5.1 interpreter written by JavaScript, it can be used:
1. Sandbox(like Figma Plugin Sandbox, but better and easy to use)
2. Mini Program/Game Dynamic JavaScript execution
3. Protect JavaScript source code via compiling to opcode

sablejs may be the fastest interpreter written in JavaScript:
* 1.x faster than sval
* 3~4.x faster than js-interpreter, eval5, engine262, etc.

It will be coming soon...
