# sablejs
🏖️ The safer and faster ECMA5.1 interpreter written by JavaScript, it can be used:
1. Sandbox(like Figma Plugin Sandbox, but better and easy to use)
2. Mini Program/Game Dynamic JavaScript execution
3. Protect JavaScript source code via compiling to opcode

It should be the fastest interpreter written in JavaScript (compared to sval, js-interpreter, etc.), it will be coming soon...
